### Hey there, I'm Mo Fan ðŸ‘‹

I don't know what I can do. I've been wasting my time and I think it's time for a change.

- [ ] Master a foreign language (English).
- [ ] Become an independent developer.
- [ ] Get involved in the blockchain field and achieve some success.
- [ ] Become a self-media blogger with millions of fans.

ðŸ’¬ I'm looking forward to the day it's finished.
